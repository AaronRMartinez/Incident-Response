Completed **Blue Team Labs Online** investigations pertaining to incident response.

## PRETIUM

### Scenario

The Security Operations Center at Defense Superior are monitoring a customer’s email gateway and network traffic (Crimeson LLC). One of the SOC team identified some anomalous traffic from Josh Morrison’s workstation, who works as a Junior Financial Controller. When contacted Josh mentioned he received an email from an internal colleague asking him to download an invoice via a hyperlink and review it. The email read:

*There was a rate adjustment for one or more invoices you previously sent to one of our customers. The adjusted invoices can be downloaded via this [link] for your review and payment processing. If you have any questions about the adjustments, please contact me.*

*Thank you.*

*Jacob Tomlinson, Senior Financial Controller, Crimeson LLC.*

The SOC team immediately pulled the email and confirmed it included a link to a malicious executable file. The Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) was activated and you have been assigned to lead the way and help the SOC uncover what happened.

You have NetWitness and Wireshark in your toolkit to help find out what happened during this incident.

## PRETIUM

### Scenario

Like every other day, Terry logged in and began working on his corporate laptop, but after a while he noticed several command prompts open and close without him doing anything. He suspects that his laptop has been infected with malware. He reports to the IT team to understand what's happening.

We have collected Sysmon event logs (both in .json and .csv) from Terry's laptop and network traffic in the form of a packet capture file to support the investigation. Use ELK or Linux CLI to analyze the retrieved Sysmon logs and use wireshark-gtk for analyzing the PCAP.

## SUKANA

### Scenario

Desi Sukana is an aspiring DFIR Analyst. These are professionals who gather and investigate vast amounts of data to fill in gaps in information about cyber attacks. He garnered this interest after witnessing his father pass in a tragic accident. His father, Drake Sukana, fell victim to a data breach that compromised his personal information including salary, location, marital status, etc. The attacker used that information to send robbers to his domicile in the United States. He faithfully defended his household but could not survive the injuries. After the funeral, Mrs. Sukana (Desi’s mom) took him and moved to Sydney, Australia — her home country. Fueled by the passing of his father and strange environment, Desi rigorously pushed through his college classes and independent studies to not only gain the skills needed to solve his father's murder but also to find gainful employment.

Mr. Sukana was the breadwinner in the family while Ms. Sukana was the housewife. The life insurance payout from his death provided Desi and his mother to live 4 years without having a job — that same payout ends in two months. Mrs. Sukana has no employable skills in the market to afford the high rent in Bellevue Hill. She is placing her bets on Desi to land a job within the cybersecurity field - specifically DFIR.

Desi currently holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Forensics, GHFI, and GCFA. He runs a DFIR Discord, Podcast, and hosts CTFs. Despite this killer portfolio, he is struggling to break into the field of cybersecurity as a recent grad. He still deals with depression from his father’s passing 4 years ago. He has two service dogs called Moxie (a human lover) and Waffle (a wild barker) for support. On his recent dog walk, he met the opportunity of a lifetime.

He met Kurt Hansen in a local dog park. Kurt is the CEO of Tesserent, Australia’s largest listed cybersecurity company. Moxie and Waffle were doing a canine freestyle that gathered a public crowd — especially Kurt. Desi, knowing his status within the country, used the opportunity to sell himself and explain his interest in DFIR. Kurt was impressed with his background and passed his information along to his cybersecurity department.

A week later, Desi had an interview with the DFIR team at Tesserent. It went extremely well. He made it to the final stages after some behavior assessments and an introduction call with the team. His final round consisted of an Online Assessment (OA). He has been provided with the KAPE output and a memory dump of an infected Windows machine. Some extra context was provided in the OA like the email conversation with the victim and a malware report. If Desi passes this OA, he will be presented with a DFIR Analyst Role with a starting salary of $120,000. This will allow him to afford rent in Bellevue Hill, get more treatment for his depression, and take care of his mother. Will he pass the 19-question OA is it up to you? You have 24 hours, Desi. Good luck!
